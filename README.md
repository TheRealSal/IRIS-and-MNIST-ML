# Python Machine Learning Classification

This repository contains Python programs for implementing Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Decision Tree classification algorithms using scikit-learn library. The programs demonstrate how to apply these algorithms to the IRIS and MNIST datasets for classification tasks.

## Dataset

The repository includes two datasets:

1. IRIS dataset: A well-known dataset containing measurements of iris flowers. It consists of 150 samples with 4 features each, and each sample belongs to one of three classes.

2. MNIST dataset: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 28x28 pixels for each image.

## Files

- `IRIS_MLP.py`: Python program implementing MLP classification on the IRIS dataset. It loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the MLP model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy.

- `IRIS_Tree.py`: Python program implementing Decision Tree classification on the IRIS dataset. It follows a similar workflow as the MLP program.

- `MNIST_MLP.py`: Python program implementing MLP classification on the MNIST dataset. It loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the MLP model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy.

- `MNIST_Tree.py`: Python program implementing Decision Tree classification on the MNIST dataset. It follows a similar workflow as the MLP program.
